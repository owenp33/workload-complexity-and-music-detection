## Description
This repository contains notebooks of a Data Mining/Machine Learning project done to predict workload complexity and music type from physiological, hemoglobin, and behavioral signals. Data was aggregated by trial and used to train machine learning models such as XGBoost, a MLP, a Deep Neural Network, RIPPER, and KNN.
